         <h3>Appropriation not appreciation</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Cultural appropriation comes in many forms. We see this in the clothes that people wear to the way that they talk. In terms of the cultural appropriation, sports teams across the United States have repeatedly exploited Indigenous traditions as well as exploit and deface the Indian community with imaging and names that are seen as extremely derogatory towards this large group of people. The Oneida Indian Nation is a federally recognized tribe located and headquartered in upstate New York where they have been since long before European colonialism. Making their mark in American history, the Oneida Indian Nation became the first ally to America when they joined the colonists in their fight for independence during the American Revolutionary War. In 1794, after the victory over the British and many hardships for the Oneidas, George Washington signed the Treaty of Canandaigua recognizing the Oneida Nation as a sovereign entity. While historically being a major catalyst in history, the Oneida have also been a primary push for the Change the Mascot campaign against the Washington R******s and their entire organization. The Oneida launched the Change the Mascot campaign as a grassroots campaign that aims to garner both attention as well as provide information to people about the damaging effects of teams like Washington that are ignorant to the reasoningâ€™s behind wanting the name changed. From protests to campaigns that involve radio and TV commercials, Oneida along with other tribes and activists have used their voice and means to make this issue no longer an issue and bring an end to the blatant disrespect towards their group of people.  </p>
