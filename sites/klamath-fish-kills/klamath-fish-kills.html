    <h3>Introduction</h3>
		<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		      <p>The Klamath river is the second largest river in California, running over 257 miles across Oregon and Northern California and emptying into the Pacific Ocean. This river has supplemented the lifestyles of Indigenous peoples for 7,000 years and has become a sacred aspect to the tribes along the Klamath for generations. However, in recent decades a series of hydropower dams have been constructed along the Klamath river producing minimal power and devastating consequences on the rivers habitat by cutting off miles of Klamath’s upper drainage. The overfishing, pollution and dam construction along the Klamath River has caused a devastation to the river’s marine life for decades. Previously, supporting one third of the salmon run on the west coast, the river now runs only a fraction of the life it used to. After a major fish kill in 2002, push for broader water management along the Klamath has been the focus of the tribes living along its waters. The result came to be the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement which is set to remove the dams along the Klamath starting in 2020. This site takes an in depth look into the exact causes and consequences of the fish kills along the Klamath River as well as looking at the case study of how the long-standing Yurok tribe has federally combated the issue today.</p>

        <h3>Modern day tribes along the Klamath</h3>
            <p>Indigenous tribes living along the Klamath River today root their culture
              and livlihood in the running waters of the Klamath. The river not only provides subsistnece but a place of communial life where rituals and respect for the earth are at the heart of the rivers
            <p>A quote taken from the Yurok website by () states the importance of the Klamath "The Klamath-Trinity River is the lifeline of our people because the majority of the food supply, like ney-puy (salmon), Kaa-ka (sturgeon) and kwor-ror (candlefish) are offered to us from these rivers
                Our way was never to over harvest and to always ensure sustainability of our food supply for future generations."

    <h3>History of the Klamath River</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
          <p>The Klamath river has long been a hot spot for commercial use and Indigenous communities due to its vast size and convenient location. Since settlers have gained control of the Klamath river, several modifications and constructions have impacted the area. A series of Dams have been constructed along the Klamath with the first beginning in 1918. This dam construction project is referred to the hydroelectric Project. Below is a relatively condensed timeline of construction and management along the Klamath river.</p>
    <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
            <ul>
              <li>1918: Copco 1The first dam on the Klamath river becomes operational. salmon runs end in the Upper Klamath Basin.</li>
              <li>1921: Link River Dam completed. control of water releases from Upper Klamath Lake is obtained.</li>
              <li>1925: Copco 2 Dam completed and operating.</li>
              <li>1928: Dingell Dam constructed on the Shasta River. Spawning habitat to the largest Klamath Basin salmon run is no longer accessible.</li>
              <li>1933: Tribal gill-net fishing is banned.</li>
              <li>1954: Federal government liquidates Klamath tribes’ reservation lands.</li>
              <li>1958: Big Bend Dam completed.</li>
              <li>1962: Iron Gate Dam completed.</li>
              <li>1963: Lewiston Dam on the Trinity River completed.</li>
              <li>1965: Keno Dam completed.</li>
              <li>1976: Oregon Water Resources Department begins Klamath Basin water rights adjudication process.</li>
              <li>1986: Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources Restoration Act passes in Congress.</li>
              <li>1986: sucker fishery on Upper Klamath Lake is closed by Klamath tribes.</li>
              <li>1988: Lost River and short nose suckers listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act.</li>
              <li>1992: Severe decline in Klamath River salmon runs.</li>
              <li>1993: Klamath River tribal salmon fishing limit is set to half the total available harvest by federal law.</li>
              <li>2000: PacifiCorp begins federal relicensing process for the Klamath Hydroelectric Project dams.</li>
              <li>2002: 34,952 salmon die in the lower Klamath River in September.</li>
              <li>2013: Klamath region in drought. Water rights are passed in the Upper Klamath Basin for the first time. Irrigation to agricultural growers in the upper basin is cut off.</li>
              <li>2016: Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Commerce, PacifiCorp, and Oregon and California sign agreement to remove four dams on the Klamath River by 2020 following a process administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</li>
              <li>2020: Earliest year in which dam removal would begin under the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the timeline shows, even with restoration processes and lowered fishing number the Klamath fish kills still took place. This evidence from the timeline shows how the operation of the dams constructed quickly impacted the Klamath river environment over one century. Currently, new progress has been made in restoring the damage done.</p>
            <p>The continuation of this case study looks more in depth into the Klamath fish kill incident in 2002 and what is currently being done today to restore the river.</p>

    <h3>The Klamath River Fish Kills</h3>
      <h4>What Happened?</h4>
            <p>On September 19, 2002 a report of dead fish on the Klamath river lead to full scale investigation by Yurok tribal fisheries program, Hoopa valley tribe, us fish and wildlife services and California department of fish and game. It was reported that 34,925 fish were killed in total with 87% of those fish being Chinook Salmon according to the USFWS. The fish kills were concentrated to the lower 30 miles of the Klamath river from the rivers mouth at Requa to coon creek. This area is mainly confined within the Yurok Indian reservation, making this tribe the most affected by the epidemic. It was also concluded that no dead fish were found above the Trinity River No such fish kills have ever been reported in history along the Klamath. This marks the fish kills as an event outside of any biological process with its cause from a human factor.</P>
            <p>According to a report done by the Yurok tribal fisheries program in 2004, The causative factor of the fish kills in 2002 was due to a low water flow in the river leading to the festering of deadly parasites. Two fish parasites, ich and columnaris, were found to be the leading cause of the fish kills. Both Ich and columnaris are fatal diseases for fish that rapidly repopulate once one fish has been infected. Both parasites thrive in low water flow. Low flow creates higher temperatures and more densely populated fish. The temperature reported before the fish kills in the river was exceptionally high.</p>
            <p>While it is known how the fish died, the question raises as to what happened to the Klamath’s natural river flow to cause such low flows that lead to this epidemic?</p>
      <h4>The Cause</h4>
            <p>It is known that dams disrupt river flows, degrade water quality, block the movement of a river’s vital nutrients and sediment and can destroy the habitat of fish and wildlife. Dams have an enormous effect on it surrounding environment an must be monitored extremely closely. A small change in operation could have devastating consequences on the dams surrounding environments and communities.</p>
            <p>From the Yurok analysis, it was shown that the Iron Gate Dam, constructed in 1962, was the main catalyst in the fish kills of 2002. The Iron Gate dam controls the 89% of the flow where the fish kill occurred in the lower Klamath River.
            The flow being pushed from Iron Gate Dam was also the only factor controllable by humans and the low flow the dam produced created the perfect environment for deadly parasites to fester.</p>
            <p>“Had the flow from Iron Gate Dam in August and September been at or above approximately 1000 cfs, as they were in all other years of above average escapements, it is likely that the fish kill would not have occurred” (Belchik 2004)</p>
            <p>Iron Gates Dam flow rate had been at its lowest in 2002 with only 757 cfs. The low flow rate from the Iron gate dam not only caused higher temperatures and poor water quality to fast track infectious fish diseases but it also gave the fish a lack of migration cues for fish. This led to a heavy concentration of fish in the lower Klamath river with an above average fish total of 160,000 in the lower Klamath when 140,000 was expected. In this case there were more fish running into a lower flowing river. The low flow of only 757cfs with an unexpectedly high fish count in the area due to the low flow by Iron Gate Dam, created the perfect conditions for Ich and Columnaris. It was reported that if the cfs had been at 1300 or above, as it should have been, it would have relieved fish crowding by 25%, therefore potentially decreasing the scale of the fish epidemic since it is known that flow can ameliorate infections. Iron Gate Dam was reported to immediately raise its cfs flow from 757 to 1300 directly after the fish kill epidemic.</p>
